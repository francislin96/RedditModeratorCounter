# Reddit Moderator Counter

I spend quite a bit of time on [Reddit](https://reddit.com) browsing my personalized list of online forums and all the social news the algorithms have aggregated for me. As with any type of social media, people must be very diligent in protecting themselves from misinformation to avoid being manipulated. Thus, it is important to understand the source of the information you are receiving and if it was curated in any way.

Moderators play a large role in balancing the Reddit ecosystem by banning internet trolls and removing offensive content. They are the gatekeepers to the information you can find on Reddit. But with great power comes great responsibility. Recently, there was a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/therewasanattempt/comments/gk0w4c/to_have_independently_moderated_subreddits/) in the subreddit [/r/therewasanattempt](https://www.reddit.com/r/therewasanattempt/) on how user [/u/rootin-tootin_putin](https://reddit.com/u/rootin-tootin_putin) was banned from 40+ major subreddits in about 40 minutes when he allegedly discovered that the just 5 users control nearly 100 of the top 500 subreddits. If true, it would be extremely disturbing that a tiny group of users can effectively influence the narrative I see on Reddit.

I was curious to see if this claim was true. Using the Reddit API, I went to work and created this project.

As it turns out, [/u/rootin-tootin_putin](https://reddit.com/u/rootin-tootin_putin)'s claim seems to be substantiated. It does really only take 5 moderators to be able to moderate 92 of the 500 most popular subreddits. Considering that a single individual can own several different accounts, having such a few number of users be able to control such a large number of popular subreddits can be dangerous. Especially as 2020 is an election year, we may begin to see increased activity around misinformation and allow powerful moderators to shift the narrative across Reddit for their own agenda. While no social media is devoid of misinformation, we must all take extra care in realizing where we receive information, how we receive information, and who we receive information from.
